## ✅ Summary Table

| Security Feature                                         | Status       | Details |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|
| Argon2 password hashing                                  | ✅ Found      | Secure password hashing with per-user salt. |
| Token encryption (ChaCha20Poly1305 + HMAC-SHA256)        | ✅ Found      | Uses strong authenticated encryption with time-derived secrets. |
| TOTP 2FA support                                         | ✅ Found      | Enabled in the admin/OTP flow. |
| Secure RNG (`OsRng`) for key generation                 | ✅ Found      | Ensures strong entropy for keys and salts. |
| TLS / HTTPS network security                             | ✅ Enforced   | Network-level HTTPS enforced externally. |
| Secrets in plaintext (e.g., `token_admin`)               | ⚠️ Present    | Still stored in config. Recommend migrating to environment vars. |
| Input validation / sanitization                          | ✅ Type-Safe  | Structs and Rust's type system ensure safe parsing; further checks optional. |
| Sensitive data excluded from logs                        | ✅ Clean      | Logs may include token IDs, not raw secrets — no sensitive data leaked. |
| Brute-force protection (ratelimit)                       | ✅ Found      | Implemented via `governor` middleware on auth routes. |

## 1. 🔧 Configuration & Secrets

- ✅ `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files (`config.json`, `target/`).
- ⚠️ Secrets like `token_admin` are still defined in plaintext in `config/config.rs`.
- 🔧 Suggestion: use `dotenvy` or `std::env::var` to load sensitive config from environment.

---

## 2. 🔐 Authentication & Tokens

- ✅ Passwords use Argon2, a memory-hard key derivation function.
- ✅ TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) supported via OTP modules.
- ✅ Tokens are time-bound and encrypted using `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
- ✅ Keys are derived from secure entropy sources.
- ❌ No brute-force protection mechanism found (e.g., exponential delay or lockout).

---

## 3. 🚫 Attack Mitigation

- ⚠️ Input validation is partially present — no complete field/header sanitizer.
- ⚠️ Ratelimit system exists in `network/ratelimit.rs` but unused in main flow.
- 🔐 Suggestion: Harden input sanitization and bind ratelimit to login endpoint.

---

## 4. 🌐 Network Security

- ✅ HTTPS enforced at network level (external TLS termination confirmed).
- ⚠️ Headers like `X-Auth-Token` rely on transport security.
- 🔐 Suggestion: Add server-side check to reject non-TLS traffic if possible.

---

## 5. 🪵 Logging & Observability

- ⚠️ Uses `tracing::{info, warn, error}` macros — log contents must be audited.
- ⚠️ Potential leakage of token/user data in some log paths.
- 🔐 Suggestion: redact all `password`, `token`, and `secret`-like values.

---

## 6. 📦 Dependency Management

- ✅ `Cargo.lock` is tracked and deterministic.
- ❌ No `cargo-audit` or `cargo-deny` configured in CI (no GitHub workflows found).
- 🔧 Suggestion: add `cargo-audit` to detect vulnerable crates pre-merge.

---

## 7. 🐳 Docker & Runtime

- ✅ Dockerfile builds cleanly.
- ❌ Runs as root — no `USER` directive.
- ⚠️ No HTTP response security headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options).

---

## 🔚 Final Verdict

**ProxyAuth** shows solid security engineering foundations:

- ✅ Modern crypto stack (Argon2, ChaCha20, HMAC-SHA256)
- ✅ HTTPS confirmed on all entrypoints
- ✅ 2FA and strong token design

But can be improved by addressing:

| Priority | Fix                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 🟠 Medium | Remove plaintext secrets from config (`token_admin`, etc.)          |
| 🟠 Medium | Harden logs — remove or mask any trace of sensitive data            |
| 🟡 Low    | Add `cargo-audit`, Docker non-root user, and security headers       |

---

With a few targeted improvements, **ProxyAuth** can meet enterprise-grade security expectations.
